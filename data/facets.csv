code,name,label,scopeNote
F02,part,Part-nature,"This facet describes the nature of the food item or the part of plant or animal it represents. The information brought by this facet is very often implicitly included in the food list groups. The descriptors are hierarchically structured in levels reflecting the natural relationship of terms. The list of descriptors is not designed to systematically include all possible parts or nature, but intends to cover all parts of plant or animal or the different nature types of food referred to in the food list."
F01,source,Source,"This facet describes the plant, animal, other organism or other source from which a raw primary commodity (RPC) has been obtained. The information brought by this facet is very often implicitly included in the food list groups. In the case of plant and animals, the RPCs are parts separated from (e.g. meat, leaves, fruit...) or directly produced by (e.g. milk, eggs...) a source. In most cases a RPC has only one source. However, more (none contradicting) descriptors can be applied to each entry."
F27,racsource,Source-commodities,"This facet describes the RPC from which an ingredient or derivative has been obtained. The information brought by this facet is very often implicitly included in the food list groups. In most cases a RPC has only one raw source. However, in some food groups, like cheeses or fruit juices, products of the same nature of the ones from one raw source, but from mixed raw sources are encountered. More than one descriptor can be applied to each entry, provided they are not contradicting each other."
F28,process,Process,"This facet allows recording different characteristics of the food: preservation treatments a food item underwent, technological steps or treatments applied while producing a food item, the way a food item has been heat treated before consumption and the way a food item has been prepared for final consumption (particularly needed for consumption surveys and includes preparation (like battering or breading) as well as heat treatment steps). More (none contradicting) descriptors can be applied to each entry."
F04,ingred,Ingredient,"This facet collects ingredients and/or flavour note. Regarding ingredients this facet serves the purpose of providing information on ingredients of a composite food being important from some point of view, like allergic reactions, hazards, but also aspect, taste. The descriptors for this facet are taken from a selected subset of the main list (actually a relevant part of the food list). More (none contradicting) descriptors can be applied to each entry."
F06,medium,Surrounding-medium,"This facet is intended for food packed in any container, together with any additional (usually fluid) medium. Not to be used to define an aggregated composite. This facet is needed to allow understanding the chemically/microbiologically relevant condition of the food (intended as the food surrounded by the medium). More than one descriptor can be applied to each entry, provided they are not contradicting each other."

The descriptors of this facet are taken from a selected small subset of the food list. More than one descriptor can be applied to each entry, provided they are not contradicting each other."
F10,qual,Qualitative-info,"This facet provides some principal claims related to important nutrients-ingredients, like fat, sugar etc. It is not intended to include health claims or similar. The present guidance provides a limited list, to be eventually improved during the evolution of the system. More than one descriptor can be applied to each entry, provided they are not contradicting each other."
F17,cookext,Extent-of-cooking,"This facet describes the intensity of heat treatment having been applied to a food item in the categories meat, fish-seafood, vegetables, eggs, bread and similar. Only one descriptor from this facet can be added to each entry, apart from the specification “Meat/fish/bakery/vegetables: presence of burned spots-parts”."
F26,gen,Generic-term,This facet allows recording whether the food list code was chosen because of lack of information on the food item or because the proper entry in the food list was missing. Only one descriptor from this facet can be added to each entry.
F21,prod,Production-method,"The facet production method describes the method used to produce the food. It is mainly applicable for animals and for foods from plant and of animal origin. This facet should only be used in case of raw foods and ingredients (not for composite foods). More than one descriptor can be applied to each entry, provided they are not contradicting each other (e.g. domesticated and wild)."
F18,packformat,Packaging-format,This facet is used for packaged food and allows recording the container or wrapping form. Only one descriptor from this facet can usually be added to each entry.
F19,packmat,Packaging-material,"This facet is used for packaged food and allows recording the material constituting the packaging containing the food. In case of combined material, it describes all the material, not only the part in contact with food. Only one descriptor for this facet may be used for each entry."
F03,state,Physical-state,"This facet describes the form (physical aspect) of the food as reported by the consumer (as estimated during interview or as registered in the diary) (Consumption Data) or as expressed in the analysis results in the laboratory (Occurrence Data). Only one descriptor from this facet can be added to each entry, apart from the specification “with solid particles”. This facet should only be used in case of raw foods and ingredients (not for composite foods)."
F07,fat,Fat-content,"This is a facet with numerical descriptors, to allow providing the fat content (as percentage w/w) of a food item. Only one descriptor from this facet can be added to each entry."
F11,alcohol,Alcohol-content,"This is a facet containing information from the food label.This is a facet with numerical descriptors, to allow providing the alcohol (ethanol) content (as percentage v/v) of a food item. The European Union follows recommendations of the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML). OIML International Recommendation No 22 (1973) provides standards for measuring alcohol strength by volume and by mass. Only one descriptor from this facet can be added to each entry."
F12,dough,Dough-Mass,"This facet is proposed to provide information on the original dough-mass, for bakery products. The descriptors for this facet are taken from a selected subset of the food list. More than one descriptor can be applied to each entry, provided they are not contradicting each other."
F20,partcon,Part-consumed-analysed,"When reporting food analysed or consumed, this facet allows specifying in which form the food item was analysed or consumed. More than one descriptor can be applied to each entry, provided they are not contradicting each other."
F22,place,Preparation-production-place,This facet allows recording the place where the food was prepared for consumption. Only one descriptor from this facet can be added to each entry.
F23,targcon,Target-consumer,"This facet allows recording different consumer classes intended as target for the food item. For laboratory uses when reporting analyses for feed, a list or target animals is also included. More than one descriptor can be applied to each entry, provided they are not contradicting each other."
